excerpt: CORE utilizes the Enterprise Access Management Service-Army (EAMS-A) authentication system, which manages access to secure Army sites by verifying a userâ€™s identity and permissions. All personnel issued a Common Access Card (CAC) are automatically provisioned in the EAMS-A enterprise directory, giving them access to login to CORE.
