excerpt: Your Account Settings page allows you to add or change email addresses, as well as change your email notifications. By default, your primary email is set to your @mail.mil email address. This cannot be changed or deleted. However, you can add a secondary email address. Both addresses will appear in your profile, but email notifications will only be sent to your primary email.
