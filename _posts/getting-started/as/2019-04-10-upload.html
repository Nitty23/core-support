summary: There are multiple locations where you can upload images in CORE, including your profile photo in your Account Settings, as well as organization logos and leaders’ photos on your Page. Specifications for the image’s file type and size may differ depending on the purpose of the image. However, the overall process for uploading, changing or removing images is the same everywhere.
