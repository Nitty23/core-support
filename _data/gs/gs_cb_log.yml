# Rules & Assumptions- 
#
# 1) (The basic syntax for yml data) Key : Value pairings and Levels.
# 2) Levels are distinguished by the indentation of that column and use of the dash '-'.
# 3) Keys can not have the same name inside a Level...An example to use is 'para1' followed by 'para2'
# 4) Do not use tabs, use two spaces when declaring a new level.
# 5) Write external links as <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and internal as <a class="underline-link" href="/topics/#as">Account Settings</a>
# 6) Surround bold content in parts as such - <strong> your bold content </strong> as needed.
# 7) DO NOT USE ':' in any text or titles of keys or values except in link urls
# 8) Code Assumption - Titles are always ordered first, with content following in sections, and only one title per level.
# 9) Code Assumption - Subtopic titles always get followed by a "updated-last" statement.
# 0) Code Assumption - Only one Note and only one Learn per section.

            description: CORE utilizes the Enterprise Access Management Service-Army (EAMS-A) authentication system, which manages access to secure Army sites by verifying a userâ€™s identity and permissions. All personnel issued a Common Access Card (CAC) are automatically provisioned in the EAMS-A enterprise directory, giving them access to login to CORE.
            note: Although anyone with an AKO account has access to login, CORE is intended for 46Q/46R/46Z or 46A Soldiers, 1035- or 1082-series DA civilians or contractors serving in a Public Affairs capacity.
          - sectiontitle: You can login to CORE using EAMS-A with just a few clicks.
