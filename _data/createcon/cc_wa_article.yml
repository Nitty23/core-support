# Rules & Assumptions- 
#
# 1) (The basic syntax for yml data) Key : Value pairings and Levels.
# 2) Levels are distinguished by the indentation of that column and use of the dash '-'.
# 3) Keys can not have the same name inside a Level...An example to use is 'para1' followed by 'para2'
# 4) Do not use tabs, use two spaces when declaring a new level.
# 5) Write external links as <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and internal as <a class="underline-link" href="/topics/#as">Account Settings</a>
# 6) Surround bold content in parts as such - <strong> your bold content </strong> as needed.
# 7) DO NOT USE ':' in any text or titles of keys or values except in link urls
# 8) Code Assumption - Titles are always ordered first, with content following in sections, and only one title per level.
# 9) Code Assumption - Subtopic titles always get followed by a "updated-last" statement.
# 0) Code Assumption - Only one Note and only one Learn per section.

            para1: As a publishing platform, CORE allows you to tell your Army story to the world. You can do this by writing articles and publicly releasing them to <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>. Each article has its own dedicated URL, based on the following formats - <br> <br> https://www.army.mil/article-id/  and  https://www.army.mil/article-id/article-title
            para2: Keep reading below to learn about some basic features available in our article editor.

            note: At this time, you must contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil">CORE Support Team</a> and request to deactivate or delete your account. We plan to give users the capability to deactivate their own account in the future. However, permanent deletion of an account will still require a request to the CORE Support Team.
          - sectiontitle: <strong>Step 3 - Customize the Author</strong>
            para1: The author creates a byline that tell visitors who wrote the article they’re reading—either a person or an organization name. By default, the person who first created the article is automatically set as the author, but you can change the author manually to attribute it to a different person or organization.
            para2: The creator’s name appears next to the article wherever it is displayed in CORE, but the author’s name displays below the title of your released article on <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>.
