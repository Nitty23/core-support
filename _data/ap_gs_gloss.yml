# Rules & Assumptions- 
#
# 1) (The basic syntax for yml data) Key : Value pairings and Levels.
# 2) Levels are distinguished by the indentation of that column and use of the dash ie '-'.
# 3)  Keys can not have the same name inside a Level...An example to use is 'para1' followed by 'para2'
# 4) Do not use tabs, use two spaces when declaring a new level.
# 5) Write external links as <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and internal as <a href="/ap-page/#as">Account Settings</a>
# 6) DO NOT USE ':' in any text or titles of keys or values except urls
# 7) Code Assumption - Titles are always ordered first, with content following, with only one title per level.
# 8) Code Assumption - Subtopic titles always get followed by a "updated-last" statement.
# 9) Code Assumption - Notes and Learn sections can only have one "part".
# 0) Code Assumption - Itemlists can only exist on the 3rd level "section", with items as "parts" on the 4th level.
