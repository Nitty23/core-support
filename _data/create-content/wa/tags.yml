            para1: Tags are keywords that categorize articles by a particular topic, allowing more people to discover your content within CORE and Army.mil. They are used to populate <a class="underline-link" href="../rc/all_content.html">released articles</a> in search results, <a class="underline-link" href="../rc/tag_feeds.html">Tag Feeds</a>, <a class="underline-link" href="../../page-management/ma/tagged_news.html">Tagged News Lists</a> on organization pages, as well as Related Stories. 
            para2: Not only do tags provide a useful way to group your related content, but they also quickly tell readers what your article is about.
            para3: Tags are similar to <a class="underline-link" href="./army_themes.html">Army Themes</a>, but they are generally used to describe your article in more detail. The use of tags is completely optional.
          - sectiontitle: Add Tags to your Article
            numlist: 
              - listname: To add a tag to your articles
                one: On your article page, locate the <strong>Army Themes and Tags</strong> section in the <a class="underline-link" href="./article_settings.html">Article Settings</a> sidebar.
                two: Click <strong>Add a tag…</strong>
                three: Enter a keyword and click <strong>Enter</strong> or <strong>Return</strong> on your keyboard to add a new tag.
                four: You can also select an existing tag from the dropdown list of matching terms that appears as your type.
                five: To remove a tag, click the <strong>X</strong> to the right of the tag.
            tip: As you type a keyword, tags that match your entry will auto-populate, along with the number of times that each tag has been added to an article. Use these suggestions to help you determine the most effective tags. For example, if you are deciding between two similar tags, it is better to opt for the one that has been tagged on more articles to increase the chance that your article will be discovered.

          - sectiontitle: Formatting Tags
            itemlist:
              - listname:
                one: Tags must be 80 characters or fewer.
                two: Use alphanumeric characters, like a-z and 0-9.
                three: For multi-word tags, use spaces, underscores ( _ ) or hyphens ( - ). No other special characters are accepted.
                four: Tags are NOT case-sensitive. For example, entering <em>Soldier</em>, <em>soldier</em> and <em>SOLDIER</em> will result in a single tag.
                five: Double check for misspellings.
          - sectiontitle: Tag Feeds and Search Results
            para1: Your released articles will appear in the search results and <a class="underline-link" href="../rc/tag_feeds.html">Tag Feeds</a> of any tags that you use. Thus, assigning relevant tags to your article increases the chance that other users will see your content.
            para2: The keyword is <strong>relevant!</strong> You don’t want unrelated content showing up in your news feeds and search results, and neither do we. That’s why we recommend limiting the number of tags you use to the <strong>five most relevant keywords</strong>. Avoid adding more than 15 tags.

            paratitle: What is the difference between Army Themes and tags?
            para1: <a class="underline-link" href="./army_themes.html">Army Themes</a> and tags are very similar. They both allow you to organize content that can then be used in a variety of ways. However, there are a few differences.
            para2: <strong>Army Themes</strong> are <strong>broad categories</strong> that align your article with the Secretary of the Army’s priorities. These overarching topics are predefined in CORE and help Army public affairs professionals to track their organization’s communication efforts. To learn more about these priorities, visit the <a class="underline-link" href="https://army.deps.mil/army/cmds/OCPA/PAPortal/SitePages/Home.aspx">Public Affairs Portal</a> (log in with CAC EMAIL certificate).
            para3: <strong>Tags</strong> are more <strong>specific topics</strong> that are determined by CORE users to group related articles. Tags quickly tell readers what an article is about and make it easier for people to find your content.

          - sectiontitle: 
            paratitle: Do I have to use tags?
            para1: No. The use of tags is entirely optional. However, we <strong>highly recommend</strong> that you spend a few extra minutes to add a few relevant tags and help people find your article.
          - sectiontitle: 
            paratitle: Do capital letters affect the tag?
            para1: No. Capital letters do not change a tag. For example, <em>soldier</em> is the same as <em>Soldier</em>.
          - sectiontitle: 
            paratitle: Is there a limit to the number of tags I can have?
            para1: You can add as many tags as you like to an article. As a rule of thumb, we recommend that you add <strong>no more than 15 tags per article</strong> to streamline your communication efforts without spamming news feeds and search results with irrelevant articles.
