            para2: <strong>Army Themes</strong> are <strong>broad categories</strong> that align your article with the Secretary of the Army’s priorities. These overarching topics are predefined in CORE and help Army public affairs professionals to track their organization’s communication efforts. To learn more about these priorities, visit the <a class="underline-link" href="https://army.deps.mil/army/cmds/OCPA/PAPortal/SitePages/Home.aspx">Public Affairs Portal</a> (Log in with CAC EMAIL certificate).
