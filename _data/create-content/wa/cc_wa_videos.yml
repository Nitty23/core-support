# Rules & Assumptions- 
#
# 1) (The basic syntax for yml data) Key : Value pairings and Levels.
# 2) Levels are distinguished by the indentation of that column and use of the dash '-'.
# 3) Keys can not have the same name inside a Level...An example to use is 'para1' followed by 'para2'
# 4) Do not use tabs, use two spaces when declaring a new level.
# 5) Write external links as <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and internal as <a class="underline-link" href="/topics/#as">Account Settings</a>
# 6) Surround bold content in parts as such - <strong> your bold content </strong> as needed.
# 7) DO NOT USE ':' in any text or titles of keys or values except in link urls
# 8) Code Assumption - Titles are always ordered first, with content following in sections, and only one title per level.
# 9) Code Assumption - Article titles always get followed by a "updated-last" statement.
# 0) Code Assumption - Only one Note and only one Learn per section.

            para1: CORE supports embedding videos from YouTube, which is a free service highly respected for streaming quality, upload ease, and video playback control. Embedding videos from another host helps your page load faster and enables visitors to share your videos.

            paratitle: Can I embed a video from other video platforms?
            para1: At this time, CORE only supports embedding video from YouTube. We plan to expand this feature to other video hosting services in the future. If there is a specific video hosting service that you would like available through CORE, please contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support - Video Request">CORE Support Team</a> to let us know how we can help.

            paratitle: How do I change the video thumbnail?
            para1: It is not possible to customize a video thumbnail in CORE. You must change the image directly in YouTube.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: Why won't my video play on my article?
            para1: A thumbnail image of your video is displayed within the article body, so you are not able to play the video directly from your Edit Article page. If you want to preview the video, click <img class="art_icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/ellipsis.svg"> in the main action bar and select <strong>Preview</strong> from the dropdown options. A rich version of the video embed will replace the thumbnail placeholder.

            paratitle: Can I remove the related YouTube videos that appear after playing my video?
            para1: YouTube automatically displays related videos after a video finishes playing. This is a YouTube feature that isn't controlled by CORE and can't be disabled.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: Do plays on my article count in YouTube?
            para1: YouTube doesn't count views of embedded videos. However, YouTube provides a breakdown of where viewers are finding your videos. Learn more in <a class="underline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1714323">YouTube Analytics documentation</a>.
