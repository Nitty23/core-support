# Rules & Assumptions- 
#
# 1) (The basic syntax for yml data) Key : Value pairings and Levels.
# 2) Levels are distinguished by the indentation of that column and use of the dash '-'.
# 3) Keys can not have the same name inside a Level...An example to use is 'para1' followed by 'para2'
# 4) Do not use tabs, use two spaces when declaring a new level.
# 5) Write external links as <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and internal as <a class="underline-link" href="/topics/#as">Account Settings</a>
# 6) Surround bold content in parts as such - <strong> your bold content </strong> as needed.
# 7) DO NOT USE ':' in any text or titles of keys or values except in link urls
# 8) Code Assumption - Titles are always ordered first, with content following in sections, and only one title per level.
# 9) Code Assumption - Article titles always get followed by a "updated-last" statement.
# 0) Code Assumption - Only one Note and only one Learn per section.

  - title: Manage Articles
    articles:
      - subtitle: Retract an article
        sections:
          - sectiontitle: 
            para1: You can retract a released article to unpublish it from <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>. The article will revert to a draft and move to the Drafts folder of your Inbox.
          - sectiontitle: Retract Privilieges       
            para1: Some users have permission to retract articles that are created by other members within their organization. In this case, the article is removed from the Editor’s Inbox and moves to creator’s Drafts folder. The following outlines these permissions, based on user roles.
            lexicon:
              - title: Contributors and Releasing Contributors
                definition: Have access to retract their own released articles.
              - title: Editors, Publishers and Administrators
                definition: Have access to retract their own articles, as well as released articles from other members of their organization.
            note: If you retract another user’s article, you will no longer be able to access it. You will need to coordinate with the person that created the article to edit and re-release the draft. If you wish to make changes to the released article, we recommend that you edit and release your updates without retracting it.
          - sectiontitle: Retract an article
            para1: There are two ways to unpublish an article.
            numlist:
              - listname: OPTION 1 - From the Inbox
                one: Click <strong>Inbox</strong> on the main menu.
                two: Click on the <strong>Released</strong> folder, and locate the article that you want to retract.
                three: Click the <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/retract_article.svg"> icon located on the far right of the title. 
                four: Click <strong>Retract</strong> from the confirmation dialog box.
          - sectiontitle: 
            numlist:
              - listname: OPTION 2 - From the Article Page
                one: Click the <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/ellipsis.svg"> at the top right corner of the action bar.
                two: Select <strong>Retract</strong> from the dropdown menu.
                three: Click <strong>Retract</strong> from the confirmation dialog box.
            para1: The article status is changed from Released to Draft. At this point, you can edit, submit, release or schedule the article just like any other draft. If you retracted another user’s article, the draft becomes read only.
            para2: <hr>
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: How do I permanently delete a retracted article from CORE?
            para1: Due to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirements, it is not possible to permanently delete articles that have been publicly released. If you no longer wish to keep a retracted article, you can remove it from your Inbox by archiving it. This will allow you to keep your Inbox organized, yet still have the article available in CORE, if needed.
            para2: Please contact the CORE Support Team if you have any questions or concerns about removing a particular article.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: Can I access retracted articles from my team members?
            para1: No. Once an article is retracted, it reverts to a draft that belongs to the person that created it. It is no longer accessible in an Editor’s Inbox. You will need to coordinate with the person that created the article to edit and re-release the draft, if needed.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: What is the difference between reject, retract and delete in my Inbox?
            para1: <strong>Reject</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/reject_article.svg"> will send a submitted draft from the Editor’s Inbox back to the creator’s Drafts. The editor can provide feedback, and the article can be edited and submitted for review again. The intention of a rejected article is to release it after changes have been applied.
            para2: <strong>Retract</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/retract_article.svg"> will unpublish a released article. This removes it from the Editor’s Inbox and sends it back to the creator’s Drafts.
            para3: <strong>Delete</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/delete_article.svg"> will move a draft or released article to the creator’s Deleted folder. While the creator of an article can restore it to a draft, the overall intention of deleting an article is to remove it from CORE, since it will not be publicly released.
