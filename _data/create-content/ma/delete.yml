            para1: When you delete an article, it is moved to the <strong>Deleted</strong> folder of your Inbox. This feature allows you to remove articles from your Inbox without accidently or permanently deleting them from CORE. Articles within your Deleted folder can be restored or archived within 60 days of the time the article was trashed.

            para1: Some users have permission to delete articles that are created by other members within their organization. In this case, the article is removed from the supervisor’s Inbox and moves to creator’s Deleted folder. The following outlines these permissions, based on user roles.

            paratitle: My administrator deleted my article, but I want to edit it again. How do I restore my article?
            para1: For help restoring a deleted article, visit <a class="underline-link" href="./restore_deleted.html">Restore a deleted article</a>.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: How do I permanently delete an article from CORE?
            para1: Due to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirements, it is not possible to permanently delete articles that have been publicly released. You can remove an article from your Inbox by archiving it in your Deleted folder. This will allow you to keep your Inbox organized, yet still have archived articles available in CORE, if needed.
            para2: Please contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support">CORE Support Team</a> if you have any questions or concerns about deleting a particular article.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: My article was deleted, but I cannot find it in my Deleted folder. Why? 
            para1: You can access articles in your Deleted folder for <strong>60 days</strong> from the time the article. After that, articles are automatically archived.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: What is the difference between reject, retract and delete in my Inbox?
            para1: <strong>Reject</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/reject_article.svg"> will send a submitted draft from the Editor’s Inbox back to the creator’s Drafts. The editor can provide feedback, and the article can be edited and submitted for review again. The intention of a rejected article is to release it after changes have been applied.
            para2: <strong>Retract</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/retract_article.svg"> will unpublish a released article. This removes it from the Editor’s Inbox and sends it back to the creator’s Drafts.
            para3: <strong>Delete</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/delete.svg"> will move a draft or released article to the creator’s Deleted folder. While the creator of an article can restore it to a draft, the overall intention of deleting an article is to remove it from CORE, since it will not be publicly released.
