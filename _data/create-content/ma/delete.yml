# Rules & Assumptions- 
#
# 1) (The basic syntax for yml data) Key : Value pairings and Levels.
# 2) Levels are distinguished by the indentation of that column and use of the dash '-'.
# 3) Keys can not have the same name inside a Level...An example to use is 'para1' followed by 'para2'
# 4) Do not use tabs, use two spaces when declaring a new level.
# 5) Write external links as <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and internal as <a class="underline-link" href="/topics/#as">Account Settings</a>
# 6) Surround bold content in parts as such - <strong> your bold content </strong> as needed.
# 7) DO NOT USE ':' in any text or titles of keys or values except in link urls
# 8) Code Assumption - Titles are always ordered first, with content following in sections, and only one title per level.
# 9) Code Assumption - Article titles always get followed by a "updated-last" statement.
# 0) Code Assumption - Only one Note and only one Learn per section.

  - title: Manage Articles
    articles:
      - subtitle: Delete an article
        sections:
          - sectiontitle: 
            para1: When you delete an article, it is moved to the <strong>Deleted</strong> folder of your Inbox. This feature allows you to remove articles from your Inbox without accidently or permanently deleting them from CORE. Articles within your Deleted folder can be restored or archived within 60 days of the time the article was trashed.
          - sectiontitle: Administrator privileges          
            para1: Administrators have permission to delete released articles that are created by other members of their organization. This action removes the article from the Administrator’s Inbox and moves it to the creator’s Deleted folder.
            note: Only the person who created an article can restore or archive it from their Deleted folder. If an authorized user deletes another user’s article, they can no longer access it.
          - sectiontitle: Moving an article to deleted folder
            para1: There are two ways to move an article to your Deleted folder.
            numlist:
              - listname: OPTION 1 - From the Inbox
                one: Click <strong>Inbox</strong> on the main menu.
                two: Click on the <strong>Drafts</strong> or <strong>Released</strong> folder, and locate the article that you want to delete.
                three: Click the <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/delete.svg"> icon located on the far right of the title.
                four: Click <strong>Delete</strong> from the confirmation dialog box.
          - sectiontitle: 
            numlist:
              - listname: OPTION 2 - From the Article Page
                one: Click the <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/ellipsis.svg"> at the top right corner of the action bar.
                two: Select <strong>Delete</strong> from the dropdown menu.
                three: Click <strong>Delete</strong> from the confirmation dialog box.
            note: To temporarily remove an article from <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a> or from your organization page, retract it instead. This action will revert the article to a draft and it can be re-released at any time.
            para2:<hr>
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: My administrator deleted my article, but I want to access it again. How do I restore my article?
            para1: For help restoring a deleted article, visit <a class="underline-link" href="./restore_deleted.html">Restore a deleted article</a>.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: How do I permanently delete an article from CORE?
            para1: Due to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requirements, it is not possible to permanently delete articles that have been publicly released. You can remove an article from your Inbox by archiving it in your Deleted folder. This will allow you to keep your Inbox organized, yet still have archived articles available in CORE, if needed.
            para2: Please contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support">CORE Support Team</a> if you have any questions or concerns about deleting a particular article.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: My article was deleted, but I cannot find it in my Deleted folder. Why? 
            para1: You can access articles in your Deleted folder for <strong>60 days</strong> from the time the article. After that, articles are automatically archived.
          - sectiontitle:
            paratitle: What is the difference between reject, retract and delete in my Inbox?
            para1: <strong>Reject</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/reject_article.svg"> will send a submitted draft from the Editor’s Inbox back to the creator’s Drafts. The editor can provide feedback, and the article can be edited and submitted for review again. The intention of a rejected article is to release it after changes have been applied.
            para2: <strong>Retract</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/retract_article.svg"> will unpublish a released article. This removes it from the Editor’s Inbox and sends it back to the creator’s Drafts.
            para3: <strong>Delete</strong> <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/delete.svg"> will move a draft or released article to the creator’s Deleted folder. While the creator of an article can restore it to a draft, the overall intention of deleting an article is to remove it from CORE, since it will not be publicly released.
