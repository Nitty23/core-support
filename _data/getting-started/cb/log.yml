            description: CORE utilizes the Enterprise Access Management Service-Army (EAMS-A) authentication system, which manages access to secure Army sites by verifying a user’s identity and permissions. All personnel issued a Common Access Card (CAC) are automatically provisioned in the EAMS-A enterprise directory, giving them access to login to CORE.
            note: Although anyone with an AKO account has access to login, CORE is intended for 46Q/46R/46Z or 46A Soldiers, 1035- or 1082-series DA civilians or contractors serving in a Public Affairs capacity.
            para1: Whether you’re a new user trying to create an account or a more experienced member of the CORE community, you can login to CORE using EAMS-A with just a few clicks.

                question: How do I obtain an username and password?
                answer1: If you don’t have access to a CAC reader, you will only be able to login with your AKO username and password. If you don’t have an AKO account, click Create Account (AKO), located underneath the Login buttons. This will redirect you to the AKO Account Registration page.

                question: What if I forgot my AKO password?

                answer1: CORE does not support passwords. Your password to access CORE via the <a class="underline-link" href="https://federation.eams.army.mil/sso/authenticate/?u=https://core.us.army.mil/login/action&m=GET&r=t">EAMS-A Single Sign-On</a> page is the same password you use to access AKO. If you would like to change it, then click <strong>Reset Password (AKO)</strong>, located underneath the Login buttons. You can also directly login to AKO and change it through your account settings.
