                one: Accepted file format&#58; .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
                two: Max file size&#58; 20 MB
                three: Minimum image size&#58; 200 x 200 pixels
                four: Avoid animated image files. The first frame of the animation will be converted to a picture (.jpg format).
            tip: If you upload an image that is not square, CORE will automatically crop your image from the center of the photo. For best results, we recommend that you make any cropping or scaling modifications to your photo, prior to upload.
