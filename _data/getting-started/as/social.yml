                two: From the <strong>Profile</strong> tab, click the <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/x_icon.svg"> to the right of your secondary email address.

            note: At this time, adding your social media accounts does not allow CORE to post anything to your account. We plan to work on the capability to post directly to your platforms in the future.
