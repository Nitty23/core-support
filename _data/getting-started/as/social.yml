Doing so will add a link to your social media account on your profile card in the <a class="underline-link" href="http://core.ardev.us/community/users">User Directory</a>, allowing other CORE members to connect with you via these platforms.

                one: Click on your avatar in the top-right corner of the page and click <strong>Profile & Settings</strong> from the dropdown.
                two: From the <strong>Profile</strong> tab, click <strong>Enter your social media link</strong> located at the bottom of the page.
                three: Copy and paste or type the link to your social media account.
                four: A corresponding platform icon appears next to all accepted social media platforms. Clicking on this icon will direct you to the social media account, allowing you to test the link before it appears on your profile.
                five: Once you have verified the link, click the <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core/support/ui-media/right_arrow.svg"> or hit <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard.
                six: If you add multiple social media accounts, you can drag and drop each account to reorder the corresponding icons in your profile.
            learn: At this time, adding your social media accounts does not allow CORE to post anything to your account. We plan to work on the capability to post directly to your platforms in the future.
