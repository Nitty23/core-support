# Rules & Assumptions- 
#
# 1) (The basic syntax for yml data) Key : Value pairings and Levels.
# 2) Levels are distinguished by the indentation of that column and use of the dash '-'.
# 3) Keys can not have the same name inside a Level...An example to use is 'para1' followed by 'para2'
# 4) Do not use tabs, use two spaces when declaring a new level.
# 5) Write external links as <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and internal as <a class="underline-link" href="/topics/#as">Account Settings</a>
# 6) Surround bold content in parts as such - <strong> your bold content </strong> as needed.
# 7) DO NOT USE ':' in any text or titles of keys or values except in link urls
# 8) Code Assumption - Titles are always ordered first, with content following in sections, and only one title per level.
# 9) Code Assumption - Article titles always get followed by a "updated-last" statement.
# 0) Code Assumption - Only one Note and only one Learn per section.

            para1: Your profile photo is publicly accessible to all CORE users in the User Directory, as well as to your team members on My Organization. It helps other members of the CORE Community identify you and your content, but it will never be available on www.army.mil in conjunction with your released articles. You can also see your profile photo in the top right corner of the page when you're logged into CORE.
            para2: By default, your profile photo is your initials, but you can modify it in your account settings at any time. 
          - sectiontitle: Logo Specifications

            tip: If you upload an image that is not square, CORE will automatically crop your image from the center of the photo. For best results, we recommend that you make any cropping or scaling modifications to your photo, prior to upload.
