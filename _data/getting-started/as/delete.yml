# ******************************************************************************************
# Rules & Assumptions- 
#
# 1) (The basic syntax for yml data) Key : Value pairings and Levels.
# 2) Levels are distinguished by the indentation of that column and use of the dash '-'.
# 3) Keys can not have the same name inside a Level...An example to use is 'para1' followed by 'para2'
# 4) Do not use tabs, use two spaces when declaring a new level.
# 5) Write external links as <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and internal as <a class="underline-link" href="/topics/#as">Account Settings</a>
# 6) Surround bold content in parts as such - <strong> your bold content </strong> as needed.
# 7) DO NOT USE ':' in any text or titles of keys or values except in link urls
# 8) Code Assumption - Titles are always ordered first, with content following in sections, and only one title per level.
# 9) Code Assumption - Article titles always get followed by a "updated-last" statement.
# 0) Code Assumption - Only one Note and only one Learn per section.

For both options, your profile information will disappear from CORE, but they do not affect any of the content that you produced. Your content will remain active in CORE and on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>, but you will not have access to edit it.
          - sectiontitle: So what’s the difference?
            para1: <strong>Deactivating your account</strong> is temporary and can be restored at any time, simply by signing in to the deactivated account. Your profile is removed from <a class="underline-link" href="http://core.ardev.us/community">My Organization</a> and the <a class="underline-link" href="http://core.ardev.us/community/users">User Directory</a>, but your account information is still in our database.
            para2: <strong>Deleting an account</strong> is permanent and cannot be undone. Your profile information and settings are completely removed from the CORE database.

            itemlist:
              - listname: The following content is not considered profile information and will not be deleted as part of a request to deactivate or delete an account
                one: Articles created or media uploaded by the user
                two: A user’s actions from article history log
            note: <strong>At this time, you must contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support - Deactivate/Delete user account">CORE Support Team</a> and request to deactivate or delete your account.</strong> We plan to give users the capability to deactivate their own account in the future. However, permanent deletion of an account will still require a request to the CORE Support Team.
