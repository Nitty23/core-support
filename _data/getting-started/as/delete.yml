            para2: <strong>Deleting an account</strong> is permanent and cannot be undone. Your profile information and settings are completely removed from the CORE database.

            note: <strong>At this time, you must contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support - Deactivate/Delete user account">CORE Support Team</a> and request to deactivate or delete your account.</strong> We plan to give users the capability to deactivate their own account in the future. However, permanent deletion of an account will still require a request to the CORE Support Team.
