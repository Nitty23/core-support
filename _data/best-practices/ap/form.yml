            para1: If you pasted text from another program like Microsoft Word or Google Drive into CORE, the text can carry over hidden styling that interferes with how your content displays.
            para2: To avoid formatting issues, we recommend entering text directly in CORE. If you like working in a word processor and pasting into CORE, consider using a plain text editor such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac, instead of other programs.
            para3: The sections below cover steps you can take to troubleshoot text formatting, reformat text, and prevent these issues from reoccurring.

          - sectiontitle: Troubleshoot special characters
            para1: Special characters may cause formatting issues in a text editor, causing HTML code to appear in place of the special characters. This issue may be due to browser variations in rendering special characters. If you copied and pasted this text, try typing the text directly into CORE.
