            para1: Writing your headline is the most important piece of your article; it’s what grabs the reader’s attention and draws them into reading it.
            para2: Army Digital Media Division (DMD) sometimes comes across stories that – though compelling – have weak headlines.

            para3: In public affairs, one of your many roles is to disseminate information to the public. The public doesn’t always make this easy, as viewers decide almost instantaneously whether an article is worth their time based on the headline.
            tip: Another way to enhance your article is by using eye-catching photos. Learn more about <a class="underline-link" href="./selecting_quality_imagery.html">Selecting quality imagery</a>.

              - listname: Here are several rules to headline writing for Army.mil articles that will help improve your article’s chances of being read
                one: <strong>It must be clear.</strong> The headline is not the place to be confusing or circumspect. It has to be clear what the headline is saying and what the rest of the article is about.
                two: <strong>It must be relevant.</strong> The headline must be relevant to the introduction and the rest of the article otherwise you will lose the reader as soon as they see any discrepancy.
                three: <strong>It must be concise.</strong> A wordy headline will not be read. Keep your headline short and to the point.
                four: <strong>It must be exciting.</strong> Don't bore your reader - excite them, amuse them, make them curious. (What would make you want to read a story?)
                five: <strong>It must refrain from acronyms.</strong> If you want your article to get more views, you have to think outside of the Army; will civilians and Families of Soldiers understand what you’re saying?
          - sectiontitle: Example headlines
            para1: Here’s an example of a recent headline uploaded to CORE&#58;
            para2: <strong>“Pushing forward, never wavering”</strong>
            para3: Though concise, this headline lacks relevance, clarity, and excitement; the reader has no understanding of what the article is about. 
            para4: Updating the headline to the following makes it more appealing to the viewer, prompting them to want to learn more&#58;
            para5: <strong>“Escaping urban jungle, man finds ‘perfect fit’ with Army”</strong>
            para6: (See article at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil/article/215589/">https://www.army.mil/article/215589/</a>)

            para3: Generally aim for a score of 75 or higher and throw out anything less than a 60.
