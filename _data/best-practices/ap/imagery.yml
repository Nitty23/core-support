            para1: Imagery should be as compelling to the audience as your <a class="underline-link" href="./quality_headlines.html">headline</a>, and draw them to your piece. Images add an exciting and eye catching element to enhance your story.

                one: <strong>Images grab attention&#58;</strong> If you include an image in an article, it will grab the reader’s attention better than a block of text. This may lead to more people reading the article that accompanies the image.
                two: <strong>Images tell a story&#58;</strong> Sometimes a picture is better at communicating a story than the written word. For example, a very emotional scene of a family that has just been reunited after a traumatic event may connect with a reader more than if the scene was only written.
                three: <strong>Images can convey a message quickly&#58;</strong> People often skim through website articles without stopping to read the full article. A picture is a great way to convey your message quickly to an audience without them reading through a lot of text.
                four: <strong>Shareability&#58;</strong> Images can be easily shared by other people, which means your story will be seen by a larger audience. You could even link the image back to an article you want your target audience to read.
            note: When taking photos for your news story, try to take horizontal – not vertical – pictures. These format better when uploaded to the Army.mil article page and are more appealing when your story is shared on social media.
