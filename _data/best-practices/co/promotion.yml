                one: <strong>Know your audience</strong><br>This means you have an idea about what type of content interests them, what they are likely to share, and on what platforms they will likely share it. You can start to understand your audience and their behaviors with Google Analytics or social analytics tools. CORE enables you to <a class="underline-link" href="../../getting-started/as/connect_account_to_google_analytics.html">connect your articles to a Google Analytics account</a> to track pageviews and basic traffic data. Administrators can also track content from your entire team by <a class="underline-link" href="../../core-community/mo/connect_your_organization_to_google_analytics.html">connecting your organization to Google Analytics</a>.
                two: <strong>Get your timing right</strong><br>Use social media analytics to learn when your audience is typically online and sharing content. This will help you establish your schedule around the optimal times for posting. The goal is to get maximum visibility without overwhelming your audience with too much content. Continue to revise this posting schedule.
                three: <strong>Improve your search rankings</strong><br>Good SEO will help people find your content in organic search results, and this increased visibility in turn will drive more traffic to your content. First, do some research on what people are searching to find a relevant keyphrase. Align your content with this keyphrase by using it in your title, header, meta description, and multiple times in the body text. You can also cross-promote the article by linking to it from your other articles, using the keyphrase within the link text.
