            para1: Once you have added multiple content sections to your Page, you can rearrange them to create a custom page layout.
            note: A section can only be moved within the page content area where it was added. Sections cannot be moved between tabs or into a separate content area, such as the header and footer.

            para1: It is not possible to move a content section from one navigation tab to another. If you want to move a section to a new tab, we recommend that you create a new section on the correct tab, and copy/paste content from the old section to the new one. Once all of the content is duplicated, you can <a class="underline-link" href="./delete_content_section.html">delete the old section</a>.
