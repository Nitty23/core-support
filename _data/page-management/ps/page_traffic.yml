          - sectiontitle: Understanding analytics details
            para1: <strong>Pageviews</strong> are the total number of views your Page has received over the last thirty days. Repeated views are counted. If a visitor clicks reload after reaching the page, this is counted as an additional pageview. If a visitor navigates to a different page and then returns to the original page, a second pageview is recorded, as well.
            para2: <strong>Unique Pageviews</strong> are the number of sessions during which your page was viewed at least once. They aggregate pageviews that are generated by the same user during the same session.
            para3: The <strong>line chart</strong> represents traffic over the last thirty days, giving you a visualization of audience interest over time. Hover over any date to see how many views you received on that day.
          - sectiontitle: Connecting to a Google Analytics account
            para1: If you would like to dive deeper into metrics, administrators can connect your organization to a Google Analytics account, giving you access to visitor traffic and other reporting data on your Page and all articles created by your team members. Simply create a Google Analytics account and enter your tracking ID (e.g., UA-000000-2) into your Advanced Settings.
