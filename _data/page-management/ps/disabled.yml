                one: Your organization must be a two-star level command and above.  
                two: Your Page must be updated at least once a month. This means your team must produce enough content to keep the page up-to-date.

Contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Page Request">CORE Support Team</a> and provide a brief justification for why your unit/command/organization would like a CORE Page – geographically isolated from the rest of the command, losing your print publication, etc.
