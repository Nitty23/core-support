              - listname: When selecting a URL, keep these formatting requirements in mind
                one: Use all lowercase. Any uppercase characters you enter will automatically change to lowercase.
                two: Use alphanumeric characters. No special characters are accepted, except for underscores (_) and dashes (-).
                three: Must be between 3 and 250 characters.
                four: Must be unique. You will not be able to enter a URL that already exists on the <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a> domain.<img class="data-img" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/page-management/ps/ps_create_page.jpg">
            note: For best results, your organization logo should be <strong>at least 200 x 200 pixels</strong> and have a <strong>transparent background</strong>. It will appear on top of a dark background, so you may need to reverse the logo colors for better legibility.
