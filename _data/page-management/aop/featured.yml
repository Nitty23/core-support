            para1: A <strong>Featured News List</strong> offers you the most control over articles that appear on your <a class="underline-link" href="../../page-management/ps/core_pages.html">CORE Page</a>. Unlike <a class="underline-link" href="./latest_news.html">Latest News</a> and <a class="underline-link" href="./tagged_news.html">Tagged News Lists</a> that automatically populate content as it is released by your team members, a Featured News List allows you to manually choose articles and select the order that they appear.

              - listname: There are a few things to consider before you add a Featured News List on your Page
                one: You must manually place each article and re-publish your Page to make updates appear live on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>. More control over your content requires more effort to keep it up-to-date.
                two: <strong>Publishers</strong> and <strong>administrators</strong> have complete control over the articles that are featured on your Page. Team members that have permission to release an article CANNOT automatically publish content to your Page.
                three: You can add, remove and change the order of articles that appear in this section. Continue reading below for more details on each of these customization options.

                two: From your <strong>Edit Page</strong> screen, select a tab in the navigation bar where you want to add your news list. (If you don’t see a navigation bar below your header, you can <a class="underline-link" href="./page_navigation.html">add navigation</a> or simply add the section to a single page layout.)
                three: Hover over the area on the page where you want to add your section. An <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/plus_icon.svg"><strong>Add Section</strong> marker will appear, showing you where a new section can be inserted.

                two: Locate the specific article that you would like to add to your News List. The most recently released articles from your organization are displayed.
                three: Use the search box at the top of the panel to find any article that was released in CORE. You search by entering a topic, tag or article ID.
                four: Once you’ve located the article that you want to add, click the <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/plus_icon.svg"> on the far right side.
                five: The <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/plus_icon.svg"> will turn into a <img class="art-icons" src="/e2/images/rv7/core-support/ui-media/release_article.svg"> and a 1 appears on the Add button at the bottom of the panel.

            tip: While you can add up to 30 articles to your Featured News List, we recommend that you limit the number of articles to six to nine articles per section. If you want to feature more news on your Page, consider adding multiple News Lists to categorize your content by topics or subordinate commands. This will allow your visitors to more easily scan your Page to find the content that is most relevant to them.
