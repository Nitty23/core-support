            para1: When you attempt to join a new team, you will be asked to search for the organization. CORE will auto-suggest options that match your search term, based on the current <a class="underline-link" href="./organization_directory.html">Organization Directory</a>.

              - listname: If your organization is not available in this list, please send an email to the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support - New Organization Request">CORE Support Team</a> to request a new organization and include the following information

Consider contributing content to an existing team with your higher headquarters.
