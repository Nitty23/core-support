You can <a class="underline-link" href="../../getting-started/as/your_organization.html">change your organization</a> at any time in your Account Settings. However, you must be affiliated with a team to access basic CORE functionality, such as writing and submitting articles.

            paratitle: My organization is not available when I search for it in the Join a New Organization lightbox. What do I do?
            para1: CORE will only auto-suggest organizations that are currently in the <a class="underline-link" href="http://core.ardev.us/community/organizations">Organization Directory</a>. First, visit the Organization Directory and search for the full name or abbreviation of your organization. If you still can’t find it, contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support - New Organization Request">CORE Support Team</a> to request a new organization is added to CORE.

            paratitle: Why do I have to be affiliated with an organization to create an article?
            para1: Each organization has at least one person with release authority that can publicly publish content to <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>. This release authority can grant others permission to release content on behalf of the organization, or they can opt to have contributors create and submit content for review. Consequently, if you are not affiliated with an organization, then you will not have permission to submit or release content on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>.
