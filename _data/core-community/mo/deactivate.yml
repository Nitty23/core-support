            para1: If your organization no longer wishes to contribute to CORE, then your administrator can contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support - Deactivate/Delete organization">CORE Support Team</a> and request to deactivate or delete your account. For both options, your organization’s information will disappear from CORE, but they do not affect any of the content that your team members produced. Your released content will remain active in CORE and on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>, but your team will no longer have access to make changes to it.
          - sectiontitle: So what’s the difference?        
            itemlist:
              - listname: <strong>Deactivating your organization</strong> is temporary and can be restored at any time by contacting the CORE Support Team. This action will impact the following
                one: Your organization’s name and logo will be removed from most places in CORE, including the <a class="underline-link" href="../../core-community/c/organization_directory.html">Organization Directory</a> and <a class="underline-link" href="../../page-management/ps/core_pages.html">Page</a>.
                two: All content created by your organization will still remain active in CORE and on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>, but only super administrators will have access to edit it.
                three: Team members will remain affiliated with your organization. However, they will be unable to create, edit or release content, unless they join a new organization or your organization is reactivated.
                four: Your organization page will be deactivated.

            itemlist:
              - listname: <strong>Deleting an organization</strong> is permanent and cannot be undone. This action will impact the following
                one: Your organization information will permanently be removed from CORE.
                two: All content created by your organization will still remain active in CORE and on <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.army.mil">www.army.mil</a>, but only super administrators will have access to edit it.
                three: Team members will become unaffiliated and revert to Contributors. They will be unable to create, edit or release content until joining a new organization.
                four: Your organization page will be deleted.
            learn: <strong>At this time, an administrator must contact the <a class="underline-link" href="mailto:usarmy.pentagon.hqda-ocpa.mbx.army-core@mail.mil?subject=CORE Support - Deactivate/Delete user account">CORE Support Team</a> and request to deactivate or delete your organization.</strong> We plan to give owners the capability to deactivate their own organization in the future. However, permanent deletion will still require a request to the CORE Support Team.
