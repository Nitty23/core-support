            para1: As an <strong>administrator</strong>, one of your main responsibilities is to manage the roles of your team members. You have the ability to assign different permissions based on each user’s responsibilities, ensuring that everyone has the appropriate level of access to content and page settings. 
            para2: All team management settings are adjusted via your <a class="underline-link" href="http://core.ardev.us/community">My Organization</a> page.
            note: All CORE administrators must ensure the people within their commands who publish/release content on Army.mil are current on their annual Operational Security training, per AR 530-1. This will be PAO/OPSEC training specific to people whose duties include operating or maintaining Army.mil sites.

                definition: Has no publishing capability, but can write and edit his or her own articles
              - title: Releasing Contributor
                definition: Can write, upload photos to, edit, and release his or her own articles
              - title: Editor
                definition: Has access to edit and release articles from all users within an organization
              - title: Publishers
                definition: Has access to manage all aspects of an organization’s content and webpage
              - title: Administrator
                definition: Controls all team management and administrative settings
            para1: Each user role is capable of everything that a less powerful role is capable of. In other words, Publishers can do everything that an Editor can do, Editors can do everything a Releasing Contributor can do, and so on.
            tip: Before changing a user’s role, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with all of the permission levels that CORE offers.
